# Python-project
This repository contains a collection of mini projects implemented in Python.
The goal of these projects is to practice and demonstrate core programming concepts such as:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding
Data structures â€“ lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
Problem-solving with loops, conditions, and functions
Example Projects
Transport Booking System (Bus, Train, Flight ticket booking with fare calculation)
List/Array operations
String manipulation mini-programs
More projects will be added over time. ðŸš€
